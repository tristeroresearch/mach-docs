# Swap POC Frontend Example

![Simple Swap Interface](@simple-swap.png)

This example demonstrates how to build a simple frontend application that uses the Mach SDK for token swaps. The application showcases the basic integration of Mach's swap functionality in a Next.js environment.

## Overview

The Swap POC Frontend is a proof-of-concept application that demonstrates the Mach SDK swap functionality. It provides a simplified interface for:

- Viewing supported assets
- Creating and executing token swaps
- Managing orders through the Mach API

## Key Features

- Integration with Mach SDK for swap functionality
- Simple API routes for asset listing and order creation
- Environment-based private key configuration for swap execution
- Next.js-based frontend implementation

## Project Structure

The application follows a standard Next.js project structure:

```
src/
├── app/           # Route components
    ├── api/       # API Routes
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── config/        # Environment configuration
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── pages/         # Page components
├── types/         # TypeScript definitions
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- A private key for swap execution

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggarza5/mach-next-first
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with your private key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Routes

The application includes two main API routes:

### `/api/assets`

Returns a list of assets supported by the Mach API.

### `/api/order`

Creates a new swap order using the configured private key.

## Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Deployment

You can easily deploy this application to Vercel using the button below:

## Important Notes

- This is a proof-of-concept implementation and not production-ready
- The application uses a single private key configured in the backend
- Wallet connection in the browser is not supported in this example
- The implementation is simplified for demonstration purposes

## Next Steps

To extend this example, consider:

- Adding wallet connection support
- Implementing proper error handling
- Adding order status tracking
- Implementing cross-chain swap functionality
