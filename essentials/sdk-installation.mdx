# Installing the Mach SDK

The Mach SDK provides easy access to the Mach Exchange functionality, allowing you to integrate cross-chain swaps, order management, and more into your application.

## Installation

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @mach-exchange/sdk
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @mach-exchange/sdk
```

## Basic Setup

After installing the SDK, you'll need to initialize it in your application:

```typescript
import { MachSDK } from '@mach-exchange/sdk';

// Initialize with default settings
const machSdk = new MachSDK();

// Or with custom configuration
const machSdk = new MachSDK({
  apiUrl: 'https://api.mach.exchange',
  networkId: 1, // Ethereum Mainnet
  debug: false
});
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- TypeScript 4.5+ (recommended, but not required)
- A browser environment or Node.js backend
