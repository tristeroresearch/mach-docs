# Installing the Mach SDK

The Mach SDK provides easy access to the Mach Exchange functionality, allowing you to integrate cross-chain swaps, order management, and more into your application. It's available on NPM and GitHub and can be used in both browsers and Node.js environments.

## Installation

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @tristeroresearch/mach-sdk
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @tristeroresearch/mach-sdk
```

### Dependencies

The Mach SDK uses [viem](https://viem.sh/) for Ethereum interactions. If you don't already have it in your project, you'll need to install it:

```bash
npm install viem
# or with yarn
yarn add viem
```

## Repository Links

- **NPM**: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tristeroresearch/mach-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tristeroresearch/mach-sdk)
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/tristeroresearch/mach-sdk](https://github.com/tristeroresearch/mach-sdk)

## SDK Structure

The SDK is organized into several key components:

### Contracts

Contains interfaces for interacting with:
- Mach platform contracts
- ERC20 token contracts
- Wrapped ETH contracts

### Helpers

Utility functions for blockchain operations, including:
- Creating wallet clients for blockchain interaction (`createWalletClients`)
- Encoding order data for submission (`encodeOrderData`)
- Market making operations (`marketMakeOrder`)
- Chain and token utility functions (`getChainFromName`, `dollarToTokenValue`, `getQuote`)

### Utils

Contains utility functions for the SDK, including:
- Getting gas values for transactions

### Constants

Provides easy access to:
- Token addresses on each chain
- Chain configurations
- Contract addresses

## Basic Import

After installation, you can import the SDK components like this:

```typescript
// Import specific functions
import {
  createWalletClients,
  encodeOrderData,
  marketMakeOrder,
  getChainFromName,
  contracts,
  dollarToTokenValue,
  getQuote,
} from "@tristeroresearch/mach-sdk";

// Import constants
import { tokens, chains } from "@tristeroresearch/mach-sdk/constants";
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- TypeScript 4.5+ (recommended, but not required)
- A browser environment or Node.js backend

## Next Steps

Once you have installed the SDK, you can proceed to:

- [Integrating Mach](/mach/getting-started/integrating-mach) - Full integration guide with examples

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. Make sure your Node.js version is compatible
2. Check for any conflicting dependencies
3. If using TypeScript, ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured
4. Consult the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tristeroresearch/mach-sdk) for open issues
