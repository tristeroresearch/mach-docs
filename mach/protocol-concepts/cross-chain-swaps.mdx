# Cross-Chain Swaps

Cross-chain swaps are a mechanism that allows the exchange of assets between different blockchain networks without the need for a centralized intermediary. This process enhances interoperability and liquidity across various blockchain ecosystems.

## Unique Capabilities

Whereas Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) can only make swaps on their own blockchain, and bridges can only bridge assets across chains â€” Mach can create efficient and secure swaps between any two chains, swapping any asset to any other asset. This capability sets Mach apart by offering unmatched flexibility and efficiency in asset exchange.

## Implementation

In practice, cross-chain swaps are achieved through the implementation of one single, secure, smart contract per-chain that manages the transfer, ensuring both sides of the transaction are completed simultaneously and securely. By leveraging each respective chain's underlying security, it guarantees that the swap process is trustless and efficient.

## Benefits of Mach's Cross-Chain Swaps

1. **Seamless Asset Exchange**: Easily swap between any assets on any supported blockchain
2. **Enhanced Liquidity**: Access better rates and deeper liquidity by tapping into multiple blockchain networks
3. **Reduced Friction**: Eliminate the need for multiple steps or platforms when moving assets across chains
4. **Security First**: Benefit from a robust security model leveraging each blockchain's native security mechanisms
5. **Optimistic Settlement**: Trades complete quickly while maintaining security through the challenge system

## Supported Chains

Mach supports cross-chain swaps across numerous major blockchain networks, including:

- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Avalanche
- Base
- Solana
- And more being added regularly

This wide support ensures users can easily move assets across the blockchain ecosystem with minimal friction and maximum security.
