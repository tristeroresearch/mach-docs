# Placing a Trade

When you place a trade on Mach, **your funds remain in your wallet until a match is found**.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Permission**: Users first sign a transaction that grants the smart contract permissions to interact with your asset. None of these assets are moved during this initial step.

2. **Match Finding**: After signing the transaction, the system begins searching for the best possible match.

3. **Execution**: Once a match is found, the funds are pulled and paid out in tight succession.
