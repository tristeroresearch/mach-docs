4. **Transaction Complete**:
   - Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the app will display a confirmation message.
   - You have successfully completed a cross-chain swap!

## Tracking Your Order

You can track the status of your order in the "Orders" section of your account. Each order will display:

- Order ID
- Transaction status
- Source and destination tokens
- Transaction times
- Order amounts

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the trading process:

1. **Transaction Pending**: This is normal. Blockchain transactions can take time depending on network congestion.
2. **Transaction Failed**: Check if you have sufficient gas tokens. You may need to increase the gas price.
3. **Order Not Finding a Match**: In rare cases, if there's insufficient liquidity, your order might not be matched immediately.
