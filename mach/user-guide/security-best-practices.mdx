# Security Best Practices

This guide provides important security recommendations for safely trading and interacting with Mach Exchange. While Mach is built with security as a fundamental principle, these best practices will help ensure your assets remain protected.

## Wallet Security

### Choose a Secure Wallet

- Use hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) for large trades or holdings
- For software wallets, use reputable options like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or a compatible mobile wallet
- Enable all available security features, including:
  - Biometric authentication
  - App-level passwords
  - Transaction confirmations

### Protect Your Private Keys and Seed Phrases

- Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone
- Store backup copies offline in secure, physically protected locations
- Consider using a secure password manager for digital backups
- Split seed phrases across multiple secure locations for higher security

## Transaction Safety

### Always Verify Transaction Details

- Double-check token symbols, amounts, and destination addresses before confirming
- Verify that gas fees are reasonable for the current network conditions
- Be particularly careful when approving token access - only grant access to trusted protocols
- Review the transaction data when possible to confirm it matches your expectations

### Start Small

- For your first trades on Mach, start with small amounts to verify everything works as expected
- Increase trade sizes only after successfully completing smaller transactions
- This approach minimizes risk if there's any misunderstanding of the platform's functionality

## Account Protection

### Use a Dedicated Trading Wallet

- Create a separate wallet specifically for trading activities
- Keep most of your assets in cold storage and transfer only what you need for trading
- This practice limits exposure if your trading wallet is ever compromised

### Regular Security Audits

- Periodically review your wallet's approved contracts and revoke unnecessary permissions
- Use tools like [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash/) to manage token approvals
- Monitor your wallet for any unusual transaction history

## Platform-Specific Security

### Connect to the Official Mach Website

- Always access Mach Exchange through the official URL: [https://www.mach.exchange](https://www.mach.exchange)
- Bookmark the official site to prevent phishing attacks
- Verify the SSL certificate (look for the lock icon in your browser)

### Use Official Support Channels

- Only seek support through official Mach channels (Discord, Telegram, or email)
- Team members will never ask for your private keys or seed phrases
- Be wary of unsolicited direct messages offering help or special deals

## Cross-Chain Swap Considerations

### Understand the Challenge System

- Familiarize yourself with how Mach's [challenge system](/mach/protocol-concepts/challenge-system) works
- This system is designed to ensure transaction security across chains
- If a swap is challenged, remain patient while the system resolves any discrepancies

### Monitor Your Orders

- Keep track of your orders in the app's order history section
- For larger trades, stay online until the order completes
- If an order appears stuck, use official support channels for assistance

## Best Practices for Developers

### Contract Interaction Security

- Always use the latest version of the Mach SDK
- Implement proper error handling in your applications
- Include transaction confirmations and clear user feedback
- Test thoroughly on testnets before deploying to production

### API Security

- Never hardcode API keys in client-side code
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- Use secure authentication methods for private API endpoints
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities
