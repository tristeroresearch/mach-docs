# What is Mach?

Mach is our solution for securing stablecoin markets across every blockchain, providing cross-chain swaps that are incredibly **fast, cheap, and direct**. By enabling instant (single-block) swaps, the protocol can go at _Mach speed_ - drastically reducing both the time and expenses typically involved in these transactions, with instant settlement.

Mach is built to be exceptionally **versatile**, offering the potential for thousands of **direct routes**. Whereas _Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)_ can only make swaps on their own blockchain, and _bridges_ can only bridge assets across chains â€” Mach can create efficient and secure swaps between _**any two chains**_, swapping _**any asset**_ to _**any other asset**_.

This architecture is focused on modularity and interoperability, allowing seamless integration and staying competitive as new ecosystems emerge.
