# What is Mach?

Mach is our solution for securing stablecoin markets across every blockchain, providing cross-chain swaps that are incredibly fast, cheap, and direct. By enabling instant (single-block) swaps, the protocol can go at Mach speed - drastically reducing both the time and expenses typically involved in these transactions, with instant settlement.

Mach is built to be exceptionally versatile, offering the potential for thousands of direct routes. Whereas Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) can only make swaps on their own blockchain, and bridges can only bridge assets across chains â€” Mach can create efficient and secure swaps between any two chains, swapping any asset to any other asset.

This architecture is focused on modularity and interoperability, allowing seamless integration and staying competitive as new ecosystems emerge.

## Key Features
