# Mach API Reference

The Mach API provides developers with powerful tools to integrate with the Mach Exchange protocol for cross-chain swaps. This documentation outlines the available endpoints and their usage for seamless integration.

## API Overview

Mach's API enables developers to:

- Fetch quotes for cross-chain token swaps
- Submit and fill orders for cross-chain swaps
- Track order status and transaction history
- Access market data for supported tokens and chains
- Monitor protocol metrics and liquidity information

## API Environments

Mach provides both mainnet and testnet environments:

- **Mainnet API**: For production applications dealing with real assets
- **Testnet API**: For development and testing without risking real assets

In your implementation, you should determine which API to use based on the chain being used:

```typescript
// Determine which API to use based on chain type
const api = !isTestnet(CHAIN_IDS[chainName]) 
  ? cacheHalfFullApi         // Mainnet API
  : cacheHalfFullTestnetApi; // Testnet API
```

## Integration Workflow

A typical integration with Mach involves these key steps:

1. **Fetch Available Tokens and Chains**: Get the list of supported tokens and chains from the configuration endpoint
2. **Request a Quote**: Get pricing information for a potential swap
3. **Execute On-Chain Transaction**: Have the user call the `placeTrade` function on the Mach smart contract
4. **Submit the Order**: Send the transaction information to Mach's API to fulfill the cross-chain swap
5. **Track Order Status**: Monitor the status of the order until completion

## Error Handling

When integrating with Mach's API, it's important to properly handle different types of responses:

- **200 OK**: Order successfully received and being processed
- **202 Accepted**: Order accepted but will take some time to find a match
- **400 Bad Request**: Order rejected by the market maker
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Invalid payload format or parameters
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeouts, etc.

Your implementation should provide appropriate feedback to users based on these responses.

## Authentication

Some API endpoints may require authentication using Bearer tokens. Please contact the Mach team to obtain API credentials if needed.

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Your application should handle rate limit responses (HTTP 429) appropriately by implementing backoff strategies.
